AI-Powered Chatbot for Government Schemes and Financial Aid

## 📌 Project Title
Yojana Scanner – Document-to-Scheme AI Bot

## 🧩 Brief Project Description
Yojana Scanner is an AI-powered chatbot designed to help **citizens** easily discover, understand, and apply for relevant **government schemes, scholarships, and financial aid programs** across India.

Given the overwhelming number of schemes at both the state and national levels, understanding eligibility, required documents, and deadlines is often confusing. Yojana Scanner addresses this by:
- Scanning uploaded documents using OCR,
- Extracting and interpreting data via NLP and AI models,
- Matching users to suitable schemes,
- Answering user questions through a smart chatbot,
- And sending **timely reminders and notifications** to ensure no opportunity is missed.

It’s a one-stop solution to empower every citizen with equal access to welfare benefits—built as a multilingual, responsive web app powered by IBM’s AI suite.
